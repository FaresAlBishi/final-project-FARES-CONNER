/**
 * 06 This is the ListAdapter class.
 *
 * It is responsible for creating ViewHolders, binding them to data,
 * and adding them to the RecyclerView.  When extending ListAdapter,
 * make sure to extend the 'androidx' ListAdapter, and not the other
 * one.
 *
 * ListAdapter is a class that takes advantage of a concept known as
 * generics. In this case, inside the <>, we are first telling our
 * ListAdapter what Type will our list of data contain, and second,
 * what is the name of the ViewHolder that will display the Object.
 *
 * ListAdapter requires a DiffUtil.ItemCallback, which we create and
 * describe at the end of this file.
 *
 * Our ListAdapter constructor has a single parameter, which has a
 * Type of a lambda function.  The lambda take and Employee and
 * returns nothing(Unit). This lambda will be created in our Fragment
 * when we instantiate our ListAdapter.
